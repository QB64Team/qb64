=== IMPORTANT LICENSING NOTE FOR QB64 PROGRAMMERS ===
All executables which perform any kind of sound operation are subject to the LGPL license (due to incorporation of mpglibdll and OpenAL).
Other components are licensed under various permissive licences.
When sound components are included (thus the LGPL is in effect), the easiest way to meet terms of the LGPL is to make your program's source code (.BAS) available.
If you are not using sound components, you do not need to release the program's source.
If you are using fonts, you are bound by the terms of FreeType's license. Somewhere in your software package should include a notice that your program includes the FreeType library (see licence_freetype_ftl.txt for details)
In all cases, you should distribute the licenses folder with your program.

It should be noted that providing source code is not the only way to meet the conditions of the LGPL (eg dynamic linking) but it is by far the easiest from a technical point of view at this current time.
