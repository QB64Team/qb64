The {{KW|_SNDPLAYFILE}} statement is a simple command to play a sound file with limited options.


{{PageSyntax}}
:'''_SNDPLAYFILE''' {{Parameter|filename$}}[, {{Parameter|sync%}}][, {{Parameter|volume!}}]


{{PageDescription}}
*Filename$ support for: WAVE, OGG, AIFF, RIFF, VOC, MP3, MIDI, MOD
*If sync% is used an opened file must have the &quot;SYNC&quot; capability to play on a side channel. A  volume value MUST also be used!
*If sync% is 0 or not used, the sound will be played on the main channel, so playing multiple copies of this sound at the same time won't be possible. (see the {{KW|_SNDOPEN}} function for more information about the way QB64 manages channels)
*If volume! is used an opened file must have the &quot;VOL&quot; capability.
*Volume! is a {{KW|SINGLE}} value from 0(silence) to 1(full volume). If not used, the sound will be played at full volume.
*{{KW|_SNDPLAYFILE}} never creates an error. If the sound cannot be played it takes no further action.
*Changing the usage of sync% and volume! can make a difference as to whether a sound can be played.
*The sound is closed automatically after it finishes playing.
* When a sound will be used often, open the file with {{KW|_SNDOPEN}} and use {{KW|_SNDPLAYCOPY}} to play the handle instead to reduce the burden on a computer.
* '''NOTE:''' Most of the QB64 sound statements and functions require a handle created by [[_SNDOPEN]] to be used.


''Example:'' Playing a song at half volume.
