[[CALL ABSOLUTE]] is used to access interrupts on the computer or execute assembly type procedures.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[CALL ABSOLUTE]]([{{Parameter|argumentList}},] {{Parameter|integerOffset}})


==Legacy support==
* [[CALL ABSOLUTE]] is implemented to support older code and is not recommended practice. To handle mouse input, the '''use [[_MOUSEINPUT]] and related functions'''.


{{PageDescription}}
* [[CALL]] and parameter brackets are required in the statement.
* {{Parameter|argumentList}} contains the list of arguments passed to the procedure.
* {{Parameter|integerOffset}} contains the offset from the current code segment, set by [[DEF SEG]] and [[SADD]], to the starting location of the called procedure.
* QBasic and '''QB64''' have the ABSOLUTE statement built in and require no library, like QuickBASIC did.
* '''NOTE: QB64 does not support INT 33h mouse functions above 3 or [[BYVAL]] in an ABSOLUTE statement. Registers are emulated.'''
