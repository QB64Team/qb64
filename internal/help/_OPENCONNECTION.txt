{{DISPLAYTITLE:_OPENCONNECTION}}
The [[_OPENCONNECTION]] function opens a connection from a client that the host has detected and returns a status handle.


{{PageSyntax}}
:{{Parameter|connectHandle}} = [[_OPENCONNECTION]]({{Parameter|hostHandle}})


{{PageDescription}} 
* Valid {{Parameter|connectHandle}} values returned are negative numbers.
* If the syntax is correct but they fail to begin/connect, a {{Parameter|connectHandle}} of 0 is returned. 
* Always check if the handle returned is 0 (failed) before continuing.  
* [[CLOSE]] #{{Parameter|connectHandle}} closes the connection. Failed connections({{Parameter|connectHandle}} = 0) do not need to be closed.
* As a '''Host''' you can check for new clients (users). Each will have a unique connection handle.
* Creates an [[ERROR Codes|Illegal Function Call]] error if called with a string argument of the wrong syntax.
* Handle values can be used as the open number by [[GET (TCP/IP statement)|GET #]] read statement and [[PUT (TCP/IP statement)|PUT #]] write statement.
