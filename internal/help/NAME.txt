The [[NAME]] statement changes the name of a file or directory to a new name.



{{PageSyntax}}
: [[NAME]] {{Parameter|oldFileOrFolderName$}} '''AS''' {{Parameter|newFileOrFolderName$}}


{{PageDescription}}
* {{Parameter|oldFileOrFolderName$}} and {{Parameter|newFileOrFolderName$}} are variables or literal [[STRING]]s in quotes. Paths can be included.
* If the two paths are different, the statement moves the original file to the new path and renames it.
* If the path is the same or a path is not included, the original file is just renamed.
* [[SHELL]] can use ''"REN " + filename$ + " " + newname$'' for the same purpose (Windows).
* Path or filename [[ERROR Codes|errors]] are possible and should be handled in the program.
* '''Caution: There is no prompt to continue or execution verification.'''
