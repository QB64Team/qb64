The {{KW|GET (graphics statement)|GET}} statement is used in graphics to store a box area image of the screen into an {{KW|INTEGER}} array.


{{PageSyntax}} 
::: '''GET (''column1'', ''row1'')-(''column2'', ''row2''), ''Array''('''[''index'']''')'''[, ''offscreen_color'']


''[[Parameters]]:'' 
* ''Column'' and ''row'' [[INTEGER]] coordinates for the box area must be on the screen except when using an ''offscreen color''.
* [[INTEGER]] Array sizes must be large enough (use width * height of the box area + 4) to hold the data or an error will occur!
* The [[arrays|array]] ''index'' offset is optional. If the offset is zero the brackets may be empty (Qbasic does not require the brackets).
* The ''off screen color'' pixels will be returned as the designated color when part of an image is off screen in QB64 only.


''Usage:''
* A graphic screen mode MUST be used! See the [[SCREEN]] statement for graphic screen dimensions.
* '''QB64''' GET statements can use coordinates off of the screen when an ''off screen color'' is designated.
* The GET box coordinates are set just like a {{KW|LINE}} box statement is placed. You can use a box to find the correct GET area.
* Once GET has placed the pixel image data in the array, PUT the image or BSAVE it to a file.
* Once the image is stored in an array {{KW|PUT (graphics statement)|PUT}} can be used to place the image on the screen.
* SCREEN 12 can only GET 1/3 of a full SCREEN 12 image (QB64 can save entire screen). Rows would increment 160 each GET. 
* A [[_SOURCE]] [[handle]] can be set to GET image areas other than the ones on the current screen. Use [[_DEST]] to [[PUT (graphics statement)|PUT]] images there.
* To GET more than one image to the same array, designate an offset index that is not being used and is large enough to hold the data.
* The [[INTEGER]] array size can be calculated as slightly larger than the box area width times the height. A closer estimate can be done by reading the array indices from [[UBOUND]] to [[LBOUND]] after a [[GET (graphics statement)|GET]] of a white box area. In QB64 a [[LONG]] array can be used for large or full screen images.
* RGB color settings can be embedded at the beginning of the array for transferring custom colors. ''Index'' the GET image data after the settings.
* In QB64 [[_PUTIMAGE]] is recommended over PUT as it can also do the [[GET (graphics statement)|GET]] directly from the image source without requiring an array.
* [[PUT]] and [[GET]] file statements can also write and read image array data using [[BINARY]] files instead of using [[BSAVE]] or [[BLOAD]].
