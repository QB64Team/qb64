[[BLOAD]] loads a binary graphics file created by [[BSAVE]] to an array. 

{{PageLegacySupport}}
* '''QB64 can load larger arrays directly from binary files using [[PUT]] # and [[GET]] # without BLOAD. For that reason, BLOAD isn't recommended practice anymore and is supported to maintain compatibility with legacy code.'''


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[BLOAD]] {{Parameter|fileName$}}, [[VARPTR]]({{Parameter|imageArray%({{Parameter|index}})}})


{{PageParameters}}
* {{Parameter|fileName$}} is the name of the file that the image should be [[BSAVE]]d to.
* {{Parameter|imageArray%(index)}} is the [[INTEGER]] [[arrays|array]] start index to store the image loaded.


{{PageDescription}}
* There must be an [[INTEGER]] array of adequate size (up to 26K) to hold the graphic data.
* A [[DEF SEG]] pointing to the array is required. [[DEF SEG]] = [[VARSEG]](imageArray%(index))
* {{Parameter|index}} is the starting image element of the Array. Can also include RGB color settings at the start index.
* Fullscreen images in [[SCREEN]] 12 require 3 file BLOADs. A 26K array can hold 1/3 of screen.
* Custom RGB color settings can be embedded(indexed) at the start of the image array. 
* BLOAD can be used to load any array that was saved with [[BSAVE]], not just graphics.
* Array sizes are limited to 32767 Integer elements due to use of [[VARPTR]] in QBasic and '''QB64''''s emulated conventional memory.


{{PageExamples}}
''Example 1:'' Loading data to an array from a BSAVED file.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
 {{Cl|DEF SEG}} = {{Cl|VARSEG}}(Array(0))
   {{Cl|BLOAD}} filename$, {{Cl|VARPTR}}(Array({{Cl|LBOUND}}(Array))) ' changeable index
 {{Cl|DEF SEG}} '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
:''Explanation:'' Referance any type of array that matches the data saved. Can work with Integer, Single, Double, Long, fixed length Strings or [[TYPE]] arrays. [[LBOUND]] determines the starting offset of the array or another index could be used.


''Example 2:'' Using a QB default colored image.  
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
 {{Cl|DEF SEG}} = {{Cl|VARSEG}}(Image%(0)) ' pointer to first image element of an array
   {{Cl|BLOAD}} FileName$, {{Cl|VARPTR}}(Image%(0)) ' place data into array at index position 0
   {{Cl|PUT (graphics statement)|PUT}}(Col, Row), Image%(0), PSET ' Put the image on the screen from index 0
 {{Cl|DEF SEG}} '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
: ''Note:'' [[PSET]] is used as a [[PUT (graphics statement)|PUT]] action that places the image over any background objects.
