The '''VARSEG''' function returns an [[INTEGER]] value that is the segment part of a variable or array memory address. 



{{PageSyntax}}
:: [[DEF SEG]] = VARSEG(variable_name[(start_index)])


* If variablename is not defined before [[VARPTR]] or VARSEG is called, the variable is created and its address is returned.
* The start index is the lowest index of an array variable when used. 
* When a string variable, VARSEG returns the segment location address of the first byte of the string.
* Because many QBasic statements change the locations of variables in memory, use the values returned by VARPTR and VARSEG immediately after the functions are used!
* Integer array sizes are limited to 32767 elements when using [[VARSEG]] in QB and '''QB64'''!. Create a larger array using [[_BYTE]]. Example: [[DIM]] [[SHARED]] Memory (65535) AS [[_UNSIGNED]] [[_BYTE]]
* '''Warning: DEF SEG, VARSEG , VARPTR, PEEK or POKE access QB64's emulated 16 bit conventional memory block!''' 
: '''It is highly recommended that QB64's [[_MEM]] memory system be used to avoid running out of memory.'''
