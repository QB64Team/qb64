The [[-]] mathematical operator performs subtraction on two numerical values or [[negation|negates]] a single value.


{{PageSyntax}}
:return_value = number1 [[-]] number2


{{PageDescription}}
* Numbers used can be any literal or variable numerical value type. 
* Subtracting a negative value will actually perform addition with the other value. 
* Subtracting a negative or [[negation|negated]] value will make the return value more positive.
* Addition and subtraction are the last operations performed in QBasic's normal order of operations.
* Subtraction cannot be performed on [[STRING]] values.
