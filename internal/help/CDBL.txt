{{KW|CDBL}} converts a value to the closest {{KW|DOUBLE}}-precision value.



{{PageSyntax}}
:{{KW|CDBL}}({{Parameter|n}})



* Rounds to the closest {{KW|DOUBLE}}-precision decimal point value.
* Also can be used to define a value as {{KW|DOUBLE}}-precision.



''Example:''

{{CodeStart}}
 A = 454.67
 {{Cl|PRINT}} A; {{Cl|CDBL}}(A)
{{CodeEnd}}

{{OutputStart}} 
454.67 454.6700134277344
{{OutputEnd}}


:Prints a double-precision version of the single-precision value stored in the variable named A. The last 11 numbers in the double-precision number change the value in this example, since A was previously defined to only two-decimal place accuracy.
