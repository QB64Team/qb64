'''OUT''' writes values to register and port hardware addresses. '''QB64 currently has limited access to registers!'''



{{PageSyntax}}
:: '''OUT''' ''register_address%''''',''' ''value%''


{{Parameters}}
* The ''register address'' is a value expressed as a decimal [[INTEGER]] or [[&amp;H|Hexadecimal]].
* The [[INTEGER]] ''value'' sent is normally only 0 to 255 per one byte register(8 bit) address.


{{PageDescription}}
* OUT can be used to change color port and a limited number of other port settings in QB64.
* Some settings may be set in a specific order to gain access to settings and [[INP]] reads.
* [[SCREEN]] modes determine the number of available color palette attributes from 2 to 256 in SCREEN 13.
* Windows NT may block access to Parallel printer and Serial ports! See [[Port Access Libraries]] or other DLL's.
* '''WARNING!''' Be sure that the address is useable. OUT accesses directly unlike [[POKE]] and '''can cause PC damage!'''
* [[_PALETTECOLOR]] can also be used to set RGB intensity values using [[_RGB32|32 bit color]] values.
* OUT can toggle the blinking attribute of SCREEN 0 color 16-31 for legacy code. [[_BLINK]] is the preferred method. (starting with build 20170816/61).


:::::::'''Color Port Palette access using OUT'''

:::::OUT &amp;H3C7, attribute : Set port to read RGB settings for start attribute
:::::[[INP]] &amp;H3C9, color_intensity : Reads RGB color intensity settings in order

:::::OUT &amp;H3C8, attribute : Set port to write RGB settings for start attribute
:::::OUT &amp;H3C9, color_intensity : Writes RGB color intensity settings in order

::::* Every 3 reads or writes, changes to next color attribute without a set
::::* Color setting is Red, Green and Blue attribute intensities in order. 
::::* Color attribute intensity values range from 0 to 63 only. NOT 64!
::::* Some [[DAC]] color attribute intensities cannot be changed using OUT.


''Example 1:'' Reading the default RGB color settings of color attribute 15.

{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|OUT}} &amp;H3C7, 15      'set color port attribute 15 for a read
red% = {{Cl|INP}}(&amp;H3C9)
green% = INP(&amp;H3C9)
blue% = INP(&amp;H3C9)
PRINT red%, green%, blue% '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
{{OutputStart}}
 63       63       63
{{OutputEnd}}


''Example 2:'' Changing the color intensity settings of the [[SCREEN]] background [[COLOR]] 0 to bright white.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|OUT}} &amp;H3C8, 0  'attribute number. 0 for black screen background
{{Cl|OUT}} &amp;H3C9, 63 'red
{{Cl|OUT}} &amp;H3C9, 63 'green
{{Cl|OUT}} &amp;H3C9, 63 'blue '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
:''Explanation:'' In [[SCREEN]] 0 this is one way to make high intensity background colors. [[COLOR]] ,15 is actually grey(7).


''Example 3:'' Toggling blinking colors in SCREEN beginning with build 20170816/61
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|OUT}} &amp;H3C0, &amp;H10  'disables blinking and enables high intensity backgrounds (colors 16-31)
{{Cl|OUT}} &amp;H3C0, 2 ^ 3 'reenables blinking and disables high intensity backgrounds  (colors 16-31)
{{CodeEnd}}
: Note: For new code, the recommended practice is to use the new [[_BLINK]] {ON|OFF} statement.


''Example 4:'' Restoring colors to a bitmap from the Red, Green and Blue [[BSAVE]]d indexed array of color values.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
 {{Cl|SCREEN (statement)|SCREEN}} 12
 {{Cl|OUT}} {{Cl|&amp;H}}3C8, 0 ' set color port for output at attribute 0
 {{Cl|FOR...NEXT|FOR}} i = 0 {{Cl|TO}} 47 ' 48 RGB values is (3 * 16) -1 color attributes from 0 in screen 12
   {{Cl|OUT}} {{Cl|&amp;H}}3C9, Image%(i) ' changes to next attribute after 3 RGB loops
 {{Cl|NEXT}}
 {{Cl|PUT (graphics statement)|PUT}}(clm, row), Image(48) PSET '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
:''Explanation:'' The color RGB intensity settings were imported from a file to the Image array using {{KW|BLOAD}}. The color attribute advances to the next one every 3 writes using OUT. The color information was indexed to the start of the array. The image is after the color settings at index 48. Index 48 is the [[GET (graphics statement)|GET]] image width and 49 is the height.
