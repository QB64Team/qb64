'''NEXT''' is used in a [[FOR...NEXT|FOR]] counter loop to progress through the loop count or to [[RESUME]] on the NEXT code line after an error.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: FOR i = 1 TO 10
::.
::. 'loop code
::.
::NEXT i

:OR

:: RESUME NEXT


* NEXT is required in a FOR loop or a [[ERROR Codes|&quot;FOR without NEXT&quot; error]] will occur. 
* The FOR variable name is not required after NEXT.
* NEXT can be grouped with other NEXTs in nested FOR loops using colons like NEXT: NEXT
* NEXT can also end more than one nested [[FOR...NEXT|FOR]] loop using comma separated variables like  NEXT i, j
* NEXT increases the FOR loop count so the variable value AFTER the FOR loop will be one more count than the requested count. 
* Also used in [[ON ERROR]] [[GOTO]] procedures after [[RESUME]] to return the program to the next code line only after an [[ERROR Codes|error]] occurs.


''Example:'' Finding the FOR variable value AFTER a simple counter loop to 10.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
FOR i = 1 TO 10
PRINT i;
NEXT i

PRINT &quot;AFTER the LOOP, NEXT makes the value of i =&quot;; i '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
{{OutputStart}}
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 AFTER the LOOP, NEXT makes the value of i = 11
{{OutputEnd}}
''Result:'' The last value of i = 11 although FOR only looped 10 times. '''Only use the count values while inside of the loop or compensate for this behavior in your code!'''
