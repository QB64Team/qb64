{{DISPLAYTITLE:_DONTWAIT}}
[[_DONTWAIT]] is used with the [[SHELL]] statement in '''QB64''' to specify that the program shouldn't wait until the external command/program is finished (which it otherwise does by default).


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[SHELL]] [{{KW|_DONTWAIT}}] [{{Parameter|commandLine$}}]


{{PageDescription}}
*Runs the command/program specified in {{Parameter|commandline$}} and lets the calling program continue at the same time in its current screen format.
*Especially useful when CMD /C or START is used in a SHELL command line to run another program. 
* '''QB64''' automatically uses CMD /C or COMMAND /C when using SHELL. 
* '''QB64''' program screens will not get distorted or minimized like QBasic fullscreen modes would.
