The {{KW|_EXIT (function)|_EXIT}} function prevents a program user exit and indicates if a user has clicked the close X window button or CTRL + BREAK.


{{PageSyntax}}
:{{Parameter|quit%}} = _EXIT


{{PageDescription}}
* Once the _EXIT function is used, the program user can no longer manually exit the program until it ends.
* _EXIT returns any exit requests made AFTER the initial call as:
:: 0 = no exit request has been made since EXIT monitoring began in the program.
:: 1 = exit attempted by clicking the window X (close) box since last function call. (Bit 0 set)
:: 2 = exit attempted with CTRL + BREAK since last call. (Bit 1 set)
:: 3 = both CTRL + BREAK and the X box have been used since last call. (Bit 0 and 1 set)
* If a return value is not 0 the program can handle an exit request at a more convenient time if necessary.
* After a read, the _EXIT value is reset to 0 so store the value when a program delays an exit request.
* '''Note: Once _EXIT has been used once, you MUST monitor your program by checking it for user EXIT requests!'''
* Don't just use _EXIT once to prevent a user from exiting a program early! The user may NOT  appreciate that!
