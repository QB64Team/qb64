'''_glGenTextures:''' generate texture names


{{PageSyntax}}

  SUB _glGenTextures (BYVAL n AS LONG, textures AS _UNSIGNED LONG)
  void '''_glGenTextures'''(GLsizei {{Parameter|n}}, GLuint * {{Parameter|textures}});


; n
: Specifies the number of texture names to be generated.
; textures
: Specifies an array in which the generated texture names are stored.


{{PageDescription}}

'''_glGenTextures''' returns {{Parameter|n}} texture names in {{Parameter|textures}}. There is no guarantee that the names form a contiguous set of integers; however, it is guaranteed that none of the returned names was in use immediately before the call to '''_glGenTextures'''.

The generated textures have no dimensionality; they assume the dimensionality of the texture target to which they are first bound (see {{KW|_glBindTexture}}).

Texture names returned by a call to '''_glGenTextures''' are not returned by subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with {{KW|_glDeleteTextures}}.


{{PageErrors}}

{{KW|_GL_INVALID_VALUE}} is generated if {{Parameter|n}} is negative.


{{PageUseWith}}

{{KW|_glIsTexture}}
