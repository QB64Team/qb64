The '''INTERRUPTX''' statement is an assembly routine for accessing computer information registers.



{{PageSyntax}}
:: [[CALL]] INTERRUPTX(intnum, inregs, outregs)


*Available on QuickBasic versions 4 up, it requires the library to be loaded. Command line: QB.EXE /L in QB4.5 .
* Interrupt number is the interrupt reference vector table address. See: [http://www.ctyme.com/intr/cat.htm Ralf Brown's Interrupt List]
* Inregs are the values placed into the call and outregs are the register return values.
* INTERRUPTX can use all of the TYPE values when they are required.
* The [[TYPE]] definition below will work for both [[INTERRUPT]] and INTERRUPTX statement calls:


''RegType.BI''   '$INCLUDE file can be used by INTERRUPT or INTERRUPTX
{{TextStart}} '' ''
{{Cb|TYPE}} RegTypeX
   ax AS INTEGER
   bx AS INTEGER
   cx AS INTEGER
   dx AS INTEGER
   bp AS INTEGER
   si AS INTEGER
   di AS INTEGER
   flags AS INTEGER
   ds AS INTEGER
   es AS INTEGER
{{Cb|END TYPE}}
{{TextEnd}}
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|REM}} {{Cl|$INCLUDE}}: 'RegType.BI'  'Use only with the RegType or {{Cl|QB.BI}} files

{{Cl|DIM}} {{Cl|SHARED}} inregs {{Cl|AS}} RegTypeX, outregs AS RegTypeX
{{CodeEnd}}
