The [[SYSTEM]] statement immediately closes a program and returns control to the operating system. 


{{PageSyntax}}
:'''SYSTEM''' [return_code%]


{{PageParameters}}
* QB64 allows a ''code'' number to be used after SYSTEM to be read in another program module by the [[SHELL]] or [[_SHELLHIDE]] functions.


{{PageDescription}}
* This command should be used to close a program quickly instead of pausing with [[END]] or nothing at all.
* A code can be added after the statement to send a value to the [[SHELL (function)]] or [[_SHELLHIDE]] function in another module.
* SYSTEM ends the program and closes the window immediately. The last screen image may not be displayed.



{{PageQBasic}}
* '''QBasic BAS files can be run like compiled programs without returning to the IDE when [[SYSTEM]] is used to [[END|end]] them!'''
* If a program BAS module is run from the IDE, stopped by Ctrl-Break or an error occurs the QB program will exit to the IDE.
* To run a QuickBASIC program without the IDE use the following DOS command line: {{text|QB.EXE /L /RUN filename.BAS|green}}
