The '''$''' is used to denote QBasic [[Metacommand]]s or as a [[STRING]] variable type suffix.



''Usage:'' $INCLUDE: 'QB.bi'


* [[$STATIC]] denotes that all arrays can only be dimensioned once using [[DIM]].
* [[$DYNAMIC]] denotes that all arrays can be redimensioned using [[REDIM]] ONLY.
* [[$INCLUDE]] includes a BI file or QBasic Library in a program. The file name requires a comment before and after the name.
* The [[STRING|string]] variable suffix MUST be used if the variable is not dimensioned in a DIM statement. The statement can also set a fixed string [[LEN|length]].
