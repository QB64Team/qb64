The '''PAINT''' statement is used to color enclosed graphic objects with a designated fill color and border {{KW|COLOR}}.


{{PageSyntax}}
: '''PAINT''' [{{KW|STEP}}] '''(''column%'', ''row%''), ''fillcolor%'''''[, ''bordercolor%''][,''background$'']


{{Parameters}}
* Can use the [[STEP]] keyword for relative coordinate placements. [[STEP]](0, 0) can be used after [[CIRCLE]] to fill it with color.
* Graphic ''column'' and ''row'' [[INTEGER]] pixel coordinates should be inside of a fully enclosed border. 
* [[INTEGER]] or [[LONG]] 32 bit ''Fillcolor'' is the color to paint the inside of an object. Colors limited to SCREEN mode used.
* Optional [[INTEGER]] or [[LONG]] 32 bit ''border color'' is the color of the enclosed shape's border when different from the fill color. 
* Optional ''background'' [[ASCII]] character sets the tiling style. Default = CHR$(0). Seldom used.


''Usage:'' 
* The enclosed border color must be one color value only. The object border must be fully enclosed!
* PAINT coordinates MUST be inside of a closed shape to be colored. Paint will not do anything when placed on the border color.
* If the border color does not enclose the area, PAINT may flood the screen or go beyond the border area.
* If the shape is not totally enclosed, every color except the border color may be painted over.
* [[DRAW]] shapes can be filled using the string &quot;P ''fillcolor'', ''bordercolor''&quot;. Use a &quot;B&quot; blind move to offset from shape's border.


''Example 1:'' Painting a [[CIRCLE]] immediately after it is drawn using [[STEP]](0, 0) to paint from the circle's center point.

{{Cl|PAINT}} {{Cl|STEP}}(0, 0), 2, 10 '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
:''Results:'' A circle located at x and y with a bright green border filled in dark green. The last coordinate used was the circle's center point and PAINT used it also with the [[STEP]] relative coordinates being zero.


''Example 2:'' Routine to check a [[DRAW]] string to make sure that the drawn shape is fully enclosed so that a PAINT does not bleed.

: ''Explanation:'' If the [[DRAW]] string is enclosed, the end values should each be 0! In the example, the proper result should be 4, 4 as there is a BF4 offset for PAINT which cannot be on a border. The result is 4, 5 because the shape is not completely enclosed.
