The [[^]] operation raises a numerical value to an exponential value expressing how many times the value is multiplied by itself.


{{PageSyntax}}
:return_value = number [[^]] {whole_exponent|(fractional_exponent)}


{{PageDescription}}
* The number value can be any type literal or variable numerical value.
* Exponents can be any positive or negative integer or fractional numerical value inside of parenthesis brackets.
* If the exponent is zero, the value returned is 1.
* Fractional(or decimal point) exponents MUST be enclosed in '''() brackets''' and will return the fractional exponential root of a value. 
* Exponential operations are done first in the QBasic order of operations.
* The square root of a number can be returned by the [[SQR]] function or by using an exponent of (1 [[/]] 2). Brackets required.
* Values returned may be expressed using exponential or [[Scientific notation]] using '''E''' for SINGLE or '''D''' for DOUBLE precision.
* WARNING: Exponential returns may exceed numerical type limitations and create an [[ERROR Codes|overflow error]]! 


''Example:'' Getting the cube root of a number.

{{CodeStart}}
  
  {{Cl|INPUT}} "Enter a number to calculate it's cube root: ", num$
  number! = {{Cl|VAL}}(num$)   'gets single number value
  cuberoot# = number! {{Cl|^}} (1 {{Cl|/}} 3)
  PRINT cuberoot#       'double type variable for accuracy

{{CodeEnd}}

''Details:'' The value returned will most likely be a [[SINGLE]] or [[DOUBLE]] value. Make sure that the return variable type matches the likely program operations!

{{OutputStart}}

Enter a number to calculate it's cube root: 144
