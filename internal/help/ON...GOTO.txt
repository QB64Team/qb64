ON...GOTO is a control-flow statement that branches to a line number or label in a list depending on a numerical expression's value.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: '''ON''' numerical-expression '''GOTO''' lineornumber[,lineornumber][,...]


* The numerical-expression represents the line or label that it should branch to, 1 branches to the first line or label, 2 branches to the second, etc.
*In QB 4.5 the list can contain a maximum of 60 lines or labels, while there is no limit in QB64.
* The procedure must be used after the number value is determined or in a loop to monitor current user events.


''Example:'' Changing the program flow when a value is not 0.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|CLS}}
a = 2
{{Cl|ON GOTO|ON a GOTO}} hello, hereweare, 143
{{Cl|END}}
hello:
{{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;you don't get to see this!&quot;
{{Cl|END}}
hereweare:
PRINT &quot;And here we are...&quot;
END
143
PRINT &quot;you don't get to see this neither...&quot;
END '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
{{OutputStart}}
And here we are...
{{OutputEnd}}

''Explanation:'' Since a equals 2 it goes to the second item in the list (hereweare) and branches to there. Try changing 'a' to 1 or 3!
&lt;center&gt;''Note:'' [[SELECT CASE]] provides a much more convenient way of doing this task.&lt;/center&gt;
