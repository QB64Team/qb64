{{DISPLAYTITLE:_OPENHOST}}
The [[_OPENHOST]] function opens a Host which listens for new connections and returns a Host status handle.


{{PageSyntax}}
: {{Parameter|hostHandle}} = [[_OPENHOST]]('''"TCP/IP:8080"''')


{{PageDescription}}
* Creates an [[ERROR Codes|Illegal Function Call]] error if called with a string argument of the wrong syntax.
* The port used in the syntax example is 8080.
* Valid {{Parameter|hostHandle}} values are negative numbers.
* If the syntax is correct but they fail to begin/connect a {{Parameter|hostHandle}} of 0 is returned.
* Always check if the handle returned is 0 (failed) before continuing.  
* [[CLOSE]] {{Parameter|hostHandle}} closes the host. A failed handle value of 0 does not need to be closed.
