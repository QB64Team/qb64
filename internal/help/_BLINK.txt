{{DISPLAYTITLE:_BLINK}}
The [[_BLINK]] statement toggles blinking colors in text mode (SCREEN 0). Default state is ON.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[_BLINK]] {ON|OFF}


{{PageDescription}}
* SCREEN 0 emulates the VGA palette with regular colors from 0 to 15 and blinking colors from 16-31 (these are the same colors as 0-15, except their blink attribute is set to on). [[_BLINK]] OFF emulates writing to the video memory and disabling blinking for colors 16-31.
* Using colors 16-31 for the foreground with [[_BLINK]] set to OFF will produce high intensity background colors.
* [[_BLINK]] is only effective in SCREEN 0. It's ignored in graphic modes.
* IF [[_DISPLAY]] is used, blinking is disabled, even if _BLINK is ON, but high intensity backgrounds aren't enabled in this case.
