'''REM''' or an apostrophe is used for programmer remarks, comments or to stop the execution of program code.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: REM program comment or ignore code


{{PageDescription}}
* Comments cannot be read by QBasic correctly and may cause syntax and other errors without REM!
* Instead of REM you can use the {{KW|REM|'}} symbol which can be put anywhere.
* Code can also be commented out for program testing purposes.
* QBasic Metacommands such as {{KW|$DYNAMIC}} and {{KW|$INCLUDE}} require the use of REM or the apostrophe.  


''Example:'' Avoiding an END IF error.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|REM}} This is a remark...
' This is also a remark...
{{Cl|IF...THEN|IF}} a = 0 {{Cl|THEN}} {{Cl|REM}} (REM follows syntax rules)
{{Cl|IF...THEN|IF}} a = 0 {{Cl|THEN}} '(apostrophe doesn't follow syntax rules, so use END IF after this)
{{Cl|END IF}} '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
