GET (in regard to TCP/IP) reads unformatted(raw) data from an open connection, opened with [[_OPENCLIENT]], [[_OPENHOST]] or [[_OPENCONNECTION]] '''QB64''' functions.


{{PageSyntax}}
::::::::''Syntax 1:'' GET #handle, ,b$

*Reads any available data into variable length string b$ (b$'s length is adjusted to the number of bytes read, so checking EOF is completely unnecessary) using the handle return value from the function used.


::::::::''Syntax 2:'' GET #handle, ,x%

*Reads an integer, if 2 bytes are available, they are read into x%, if not then nothing is read and EOF(handle) will return -1 (and x%'s value will be undefined) using the handle return value from the function used.


:::::'''Communicating using unformatted/raw streamed data:'''
* Benefit: Communicate with any TCP/IP compatible protocol (eg. FTP, HTTP, web-pages, etc)
* Disadvantage: Streamed data has no 'message length' as such, just a continuous bunch of bytes all in a row. Some messages get fragmented and parts of messages can (and often do) arrive at different times. 
* The position parameter(between the commas) is not used in TCP/IP statements.
:::::'''Your program MUST cater for these situations manually.'''


''Example:''

{{CodeStart}}
 {{Cl|PUT|PUT #}}c, , a$ ' sends data 
 {{Cl|GET|GET #}}o, , b$ ' reads any available data into variable length string b$  
 {{Cl|GET|GET #}}o, , x% ' if 2 bytes are available, they are read into x%
{{CodeEnd}}

''Explanation:'' 
* Data could be a string, variable array, user defined [[TYPE]], etc.
* b$'s length is adjusted to the number of bytes read. Checking [[EOF]](o) is  unnecessary. 
* If 2 bytes are not available for the x% integer then nothing is read and [[EOF]](o) will return -1
