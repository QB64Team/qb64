{{DISPLAYTITLE:_MOUSEMOVE}}
The [[_MOUSEMOVE]] statement moves the mouse pointer to a new position on the screen as determined by the column and row coordinates.


{{PageSyntax}} 
:[[_MOUSEMOVE]] {{Parameter|column%}}, {{Parameter|row%}}


{{PageParameters}}
* {{Parameter|column%}} is the horizontal pixel coordinate to place the mouse pointer and can be any value from 0 to [[_WIDTH (function)|_WIDTH]](0) - 1.
* {{Parameter|row%}} is the vertical pixel position to place the mouse pointer and can be any value from 0 to [[_HEIGHT]](0) - 1


{{PageDescription}}
* Maximum coordinate values are based on a program's current [[SCREEN]] mode resolution or the pixel size set by [[_NEWIMAGE]].
* [[SCREEN]] 0 uses text block coordinates. '''Coordinates off the screen area will create an "Illegal Function Call" [[ERROR Codes|ERROR]]'''
* Can be used to position the pointer to a default dialog button or move the cursor away from a button so it is not clicked twice.
* Does not require [[_MOUSEINPUT]] to be used, but all moves will be remembered and can be read by mouse functions.


{{PageAvailability}}
* Versions prior to 1.000 (Version 1.000 had this function disabled for compatibility reasons).
* Version 1.1 and up.

: ''Explanation:'' The [[_MOUSEINPUT]] function will hold previous and _MOUSEMOVE events so press any key when you want to quit.

: '''Note: [[INPUT]], [[INPUT$]] and [[LINE INPUT]] will allow continued reading of mouse events while awaiting program user input!'''
: It is recommended that a [[WHILE]] [[_MOUSEINPUT]]: [[WEND]] loop be used immediately after to clear stored mouse events.
