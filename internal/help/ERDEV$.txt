{{PageSyntax}}
::device$ = ERDEV$


*'''[[Keywords currently not supported by QB64|Currently NOT supported in QB64!]]'''
* It will contain the 8-byte character device name if the error was declared by a character device (such as a printer), while it will contain the 2-byte block name (A:, B:, etc.) if the device was not a character device.
* It is set when [[ERDEV]] is set, meaning that DOS has encountered a error that prevents it from continuing.
