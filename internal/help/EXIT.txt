The [[EXIT]] statement is used to exit certain QBasic procedures.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[EXIT]] {DO|WHILE|FOR|SUB|FUNCTION|SELECT|CASE}


{{PageDescription}}
* [[EXIT]] leaves any of the following procedures immediately.
** [[EXIT]] DO exits a [[DO...LOOP]].
** [[EXIT]] WHILE exits a [[WHILE...WEND]] loop.
** [[EXIT]] FOR exits a [[FOR...NEXT]] counter loop.
** [[EXIT]] SUB exits a [[SUB]] procedure before it ends. Use before any [[GOSUB]] procedures using [[RETURN]].
** [[EXIT]] FUNCTION exits a [[FUNCTION]] procedure before it ends. The value passed by the function's name should be defined.
** [[EXIT]] SELECT exits a [[SELECT CASE]] block.
** [[EXIT]] CASE does the same as EXIT SELECT unless when used in a '''SELECT EVERYCASE''' block; in such case, execution proceeds to the next CASE evaluation.
* EXIT statements normally use an [[IF...THEN]] statement to evaluate a program condition that would require the EXIT.
* To exit a program and allow the last program screen to be displayed with the message "Press any key to continue...", use [[END]].
* To exit the program immediately, use [[SYSTEM]].


{{PageAvailability}}
* '''EXIT SELECT/CASE''' available with version 1.5.
* All other variants available in all versions of QB64.
