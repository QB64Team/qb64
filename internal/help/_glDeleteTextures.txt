'''_glDeleteTextures:''' delete named textures


{{PageSyntax}}

:  SUB _glDeleteTextures (BYVAL n AS LONG, textures AS _UNSIGNED LONG)

:  void '''_glDeleteTextures'''(GLsizei {{Parameter|n}}, const GLuint * {{Parameter|textures}});


; n
: Specifies the number of textures to be deleted.
; textures
: Specifies an array of textures to be deleted.


{{PageDescription}}

'''_glDeleteTextures''' deletes {{Parameter|n}} textures named by the elements of the array {{Parameter|textures}}. After a texture is deleted, it has no contents or dimensionality, and its name is free for reuse (for example by {{KW|_glGenTextures}}). If a texture that is currently bound is deleted, the binding reverts to 0 (the default texture).

'''_glDeleteTextures''' silently ignores 0's and names that do not correspond to existing textures.


{{PageErrors}}

{{KW|_GL_INVALID_VALUE}} is generated if {{Parameter|n}} is negative.
