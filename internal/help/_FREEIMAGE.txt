The '''_FREEIMAGE''' statement releases the designated file image created by the {{KW|_LOADIMAGE}}, {{KW|_NEWIMAGE}} or {{KW|_COPYIMAGE}} functions from memory when they are no longer needed.


{{PageSyntax}}
:_FREEIMAGE [handle&amp;]


{{PageDescription}}
*If {{Parameter|handle}} is omitted, the current destination image is freed from memory. '''Do NOT free the current program SCREEN mode!'''
*Freeing the destination image or source image will result in the display page being selected instead.
*'''Invalid image handle values of -1 or 0 cannot be freed or an [[ERROR Codes|&quot;Illegal Function&quot; error]] will occur!'''! Check the value!
* '''[[SCREEN]] modes in use cannot be freed or an [[ERROR Codes|&quot;Illegal Function&quot; error]] will occur!''' Change SCREEN modes before freeing. 
*Once a specific image handle is no longer used or referenced by your program, it can be freed with [[_FREEIMAGE]].
*  '''Images are not deallocated when the [[SUB]] or [[FUNCTION]] they are created in ends. Free them with [[_FREEIMAGE]].'''
* '''It is IMPORTANT to free unused or uneeded images with [[_FREEIMAGE]] to prevent memory overflow errors!'''
* '''Do NOT try to free image handles currently being used as the active [[SCREEN]]! Change screen modes first.'''



''Example:'' Loading a program splash screen and freeing image when no longer necessary:
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
s&amp; = {{Cl|_LOADIMAGE}}(&quot;SPLASH.BMP&quot;,32)  'load 32 bit(24 BPP) image

{{Cl|IF}} s&amp; &lt; -1 THEN {{Cl|SCREEN (statement)|SCREEN}} s&amp;   'use image as a 32 bit SCREEN 

{{Cl|_DELAY}} 6                          'display splash screen for 6 seconds

{{Cl|SCREEN (statement)|SCREEN}} 0       'MUST change screen mode before freeing a SCREEN image!

{{Cl|IF}} s&amp; &lt; -1 THEN {{Cl|_FREEIMAGE}} s&amp;  'handle value MUST be less than -1 or error!

{{Cl|CLS}} '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
: ''Note:'' A valid image file name must be used by [[_LOADIMAGE]] or the invalid handle memory value will not need to be freed.
