The '''STOP''' statement is used to stop program execution when troubleshooting a program or to suspend event trapping.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: STOP


* STOP used in the Qbasic IDE does not close any files or go to the operating system. It returns to the IDE.
* In the QB64 compiler, STOP closes the program window and returns to the [[IDE]] when the code is compiled from there.
* STOP is ONLY used for debugging purposes and should not be used to exit programs!
* STOP can also be used to suspend an event trap in the following statements: [[KEY(n)]], [[ON COM (n)|COM(n)]], [[PEN]], [[PLAY]], [[STRIG(n)]], [[TIMER]], [[UEVENT]]. The trap can be turned back on with [[ON]] and returns any trap events since '''STOP''' was used.


''Example:'' When run in the Qbasic IDE, the program will return to the IDE at STOP. Press F5 to finish the program.
