'''Metacommands''' are program wide commands that start with $.


==Legacy metacommands (Qbasic/QuickBASIC)==
===Syntax===
:REM [[$INCLUDE]]: '[[QB.BI]]' 'loads a reference file or library

:REM [[$DYNAMIC]] 'enables resizing of array dimensions with REDIM

:REM [[$STATIC]] 'arrays cannot be resized once dimensioned

===Description===
* Qbasic Metacommands are normally used at the program start and are in effect throughout the program.
* Qbasic Metacommands are always prefixed with $ and MUST be commented with an apostrophe or [[REM]].
* [[$INCLUDE]] is always followed by a colon and the full text code file name is commented on both sides.
* [[$DYNAMIC]] allows larger arrays that are changeable in size at runtime.
* [[$STATIC]] makes all arrays unchangeable in size.
* '''Qbasic metacommands should have their own program line because they are commented.'''


==QB64 metacommands==
===Syntax===
:[[$CHECKING]]{OFF|ON} 'disables QB64 C++ event and error checking (no spaces)

:[[$CONSOLE]] 'creates a QB64 console window throughout the program

:[[$RESIZE]]:{ON|OFF} 'determines if re-sizing of the program screen by the user is allowed(no spaces)

:[[$SCREENHIDE]] 'hides the QB64 program window throughout the program

:[[$SCREENSHOW]] 'displays the main QB64 program window

:[[$EXEICON]]:'iconfile.ico' 'embeds an .ICO file into the final executable (Windows only)

:[[$VERSIONINFO]]:key=value 'embeds version info metadata into the final executable (Windows only)

:[[$IF]]...[[$END IF]] 'precompiler directive

: [[$ERROR]] MESSAGE 'trigger a compilation error, useful inside $IF blocks


===Description===
* [[$INCLUDE]] can be used at the beginning or at the end of program SUB procedures.
* [[$CHECKING]]:OFF should only be used with '''errorless''' code where every CPU cycle counts! Use '''ON''' to re-enable event checking. Event checking can be turned OFF or ON throughout a program.
* [[$CONSOLE]] creates a console window which can be turned off later with [[_CONSOLE]] OFF.
* [[$RESIZE]]:ON allows a user to resize the program window. OFF is default.
* [[$SCREENHIDE]] hides the QB64 program window throughout the program until [[$SCREENSHOW]] is used.
* [[$IF]]...[[$END IF]] allows selective inclusion of code in the final program.
* [[$ERROR]] MESSAGE causes a compilation error whenever QB64 attempts to compile it, displaying MESSAGE to the user. This is useful if inside a $IF block, as the error can be conditional.
* '''Do not comment out with ' or [[REM]] QB64-specific metacommands.'''
