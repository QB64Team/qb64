The '''OR''' coditional operator adds an alternative in a [[IF...THEN]] or [[Boolean]] statement.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: IF a = 1 '''OR''' a = 2 THEN a = 0


* OR adds an alternative to another conditional evaluation. IF True then the statement evaluation is True.
* Parenthesis may be used to clarify the order of comparisons in an evaluation.
* [[AND]] and '''OR''' cannot be used to combine command line operations.
* '''A double OR syntax error may be ignored and create a QB64 compiler error!'''
* Not to be confused with the [[AND]] and [[OR]] numerical operations.

''Example:''

a% = 100
b% = 50

{{CodeEnd}}
{{OutputStart}}
True
{{OutputEnd}}
: ''Explanation:'' The first evaluation was False, but the OR evaluation made the statement true and the code was executed.
