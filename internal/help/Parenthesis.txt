'''Parenthesis''' are used to enclose [[SUB]] and [[FUNCTION]] parameters or to set the operation order in [[Mathematical Operations]].


''Usage:'' COLOR 14: PRINT [[TAB]](30); "Hello World"

{{OutputStart}}
                              {{text|Hello World|yellow}}
{{OutputEnd}}


* [[SUB]] parameters MUST be enclosed in parenthesis when the [[CALL]] statement is used. Do '''not''' use parenthesis without CALL.
* Parenthesis can be used in calculations to determine the order in which math operations are performed when the normal order would not work correctly. Normal operation order is: '''1)''' exponential, '''2)''' multiplication or division '''3)''' addition or subtraction.
* Parenthesis can also denote the array index or the dimension size(s) in a [[DIM]] statement.
* Instead of [[BYVAL]], use extra parenthesis around sub-procedure call parameters to pass them by value instead of by reference.
* Extra pairs of brackets have no effect on the code! If one is missing the IDE should tell you.


''Example:'' Using too many brackets does not harm the code execution as long as they are paired up.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
nmb$ = {{Cl|STR$}}(100)
nmb$ = {{Cl|LTRIM$}}((({{Cl|RTRIM$}}(nmb$))))  'extra bracket pairs do not affect the code

{{Cl|PRINT}} nmb$ '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
