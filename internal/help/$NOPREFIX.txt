The [[$NOPREFIX]] metacommand allows all QB64 functions and statements to be used without the leading underscore (_).


{{PageSyntax}}
:[[$NOPREFIX]]


{{PageDescription}}
* QB64-specific keywords are by default prefixed with an underscore, in order to differentiate them from legacy keywords inherited from QBasic/QuickBASIC 4.5.
* The convention exists in order to allow older code to be loaded and compiled in QB64 without naming conflicts with existing variables or constants.
* If you are writing new code with QB64, and not importing code from QBasic/QuickBASIC 4.5, [[$NOPREFIX]] allows you to reduce typing by not having to use underscores in modern keywords.
* '''SUB _GL''' still must be prefixed.
* When [[$NOPREFIX]] is used, QB64 keywords can be used both with or without the leading underscore, so that both [[_DISPLAY]] and [[_DISPLAY|DISPLAY]] are valid in the same program, for example.
* [[$NOPREFIX]] can be placed anywhere in a program.


{{PageAvailability}}
* Version 1.4 and up.
