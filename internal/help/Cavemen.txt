'''Cavemen''' lived thousands of years ago in caves or primitive shelters.


* Using simple technology, such as clubs, they acquired food and women.
* They often used short utterances called grunts and snarls.
* In 7,000 BC they came up with the word [[LET]]. Linguists believe that this word was used in sentences such as "Let GRRRR!" or "Let MEEE!".  Since then, the word LET has featured prominently in the design of the BASIC programming language.
* Why are you here? Did you look up '''LET'''? Too bad! Tell your teacher to actually teach you something!
