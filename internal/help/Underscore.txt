{{PageDescription}}

* The underscore can be anywhere after the code on that line to continue the code to the next line in QB64.
* Multiple underscores can be used for the same line of code.
* Comments cannot follow an underscore and are not continued on the next line if they end in an underscore. 
* Modern QB64 keywords are preceded by an underscore, unless [[$NOPREFIX]] is used. Variables and user procedures names cannot start with a single underscore.
** Variables and user procedures names can be preceded by double underscores if necessary.
* Underscores can be used in the middle of variable, sub procedure or [[CONST|constant]] names.
* In [[PRINT USING]] an underscore can precede a formatting character to display that character as literal text in a template [[STRING]].
