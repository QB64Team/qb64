An '''underscore''' can be used at the end of a line of code to continue a code line to the next line.



''Usage:'' IF x + y > 500 AND x + y &lt; 600 THEN_              
:::PRINT x + y


* '''Only QB64 keywords can use a leading underscore! Leading underscores are reserved for QB64 procedure names only!'''
* The underscore can be anywhere after the code on that line to continue the code to the next line in QB64.
* Multiple underscores can be used for the same line of code in QB64 only.
* Underscores can be used in the middle of variable, sub procedure or [[CONST|constant]] names.
* '''The underscore is NOT compatible with QBasic! The QBasic IDE will remove or move code with leading underscores!'''
* In [[PRINT USING]] an underscore can precede a formatting character to display that character as text in a template [[STRING]].
