The '''LOF''' Function is used to find the length of an [[OPEN]] file in bytes.



{{PageSyntax}}
:: bytes% = LOF(filenumber%)


* LOF returns the number of bytes in an OPENed designated filenumber. File is empty if it returns 0.
* Filenumber is the number of the opened file. # is not required.
* Often used to determine the number of records in a [[RANDOM]] access file.
* Can also be used to avoid reading an empty file, which would create an error.
* LOF in '''QB64''' can return up to 9223372036 gigabyte file sizes.


''Example:'' Finding the number of records in a RANDOM file using a [[TYPE]] variable.

{{CodeStart}}
  OPEN file$ FOR RANDOM AS #1 LEN = {{Cl|LEN}}(Type_variable)
  NumRecords% = {{Cl|LOF}}(1) \ RecordLEN%
{{CodeEnd}}
