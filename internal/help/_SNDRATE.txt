The '''_SNDRATE''' function returns the sample rate frequency per second of the current computer's sound card.


{{PageSyntax}}
::''SampleRate'' = _SNDRATE


* The sample rate frequency per second value returned can be any [[INTEGER]] value. Often it is set at 22050.
* When used with [[_SNDRAW]] it can determine the time that a raw sound has been made. Example: t = t + 1 / _SNDRATE
* '''The sound card sample rate is determined by the sound card and it CANNOT be changed!'''
