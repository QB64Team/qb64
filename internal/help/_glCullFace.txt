'''_glCullFace:''' specify whether front- or back-facing facets can be culled


{{PageSyntax}}

::SUB '''_glCullFace''' (BYVAL mode AS _UNSIGNED LONG)
:: void '''_glCullFace'''(GLenum {{Parameter|mode}});


; mode
: Specifies whether front- or back-facing facets are candidates for culling. Symbolic constants {{KW|_GL_FRONT}}, {{KW|_GL_BACK}}, and {{KW|_GL_FRONT_AND_BACK}} are accepted. The initial value is {{KW|_GL_BACK}}.


{{PageDescription}}

'''_glCullFace''' specifies whether front- or back-facing facets are culled (as specified by ''mode'') when facet culling is enabled. Facet culling is initially disabled. To enable and disable facet culling, call the {{KW|_glEnable}} and {{KW|_glDisable}} commands with the argument {{KW|_GL_CULL_FACE}}. Facets include triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, and rectangles.

{{KW|_glFrontFace}} specifies which of the clockwise and counterclockwise facets are front-facing and back-facing. See {{KW|_glFrontFace}}.


{{PageNotes}}

If {{Parameter|mode}} is {{KW|_GL_FRONT_AND_BACK}}, no facets are drawn, but other primitives such as points and lines are drawn.


{{PageErrors}}

{{KW|_GL_INVALID_ENUM}} is generated if {{Parameter|mode}} is not an accepted value.


{{PageUseWith}}

{{KW|_glIsEnabled}} with argument {{KW|_GL_CULL_FACE}}

{{KW|_glGet}} with argument {{KW|_GL_CULL_FACE_MODE}}
