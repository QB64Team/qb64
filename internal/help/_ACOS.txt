{{DISPLAYTITLE:_ACOS}}
The [[_ACOS]] function returns the angle measured in radians based on an input [[COS]]ine value ranging from -1 to 1.


{{PageSyntax}}
: {{Parameter|radian_angle!}} = [[_ACOS]]({{Parameter|cosine_value!}})

{{PageDescription}}
* The ''cosine_value!'' must be measured >= -1 and &lt;= 1, or an error will be generated.  (PRINT _ACOS(1.2) would give the result of -1.#IND, which is basically QB64's way of telling us that the number doesn't exist, much like 1/0 would.) 
* ARCCOSINE is the inverse function of [[COS]]ine, which lets us turn a [[COS]]ine value back into an angle.
* Note: Due to rounding with floating point math, the _ACOS may not always give a perfect match for the COS angle which generated this.  You can reduce the number of rounding errors by increasing the precision of your calculations by using [[DOUBLE]] or [[_FLOAT]] precision variables instead of [[SINGLE]].

{{OutputStart}}
Give me an Angle (in Degrees) => ? 60

The COSINE of the Angle is:  .5000000000000001
The ACOS of  .5000000000000001  is:  1.047197551196598
Notice, A is the Angle in Radians.  If we convert it to degrees, we discover the value is  60
