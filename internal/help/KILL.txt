The [[KILL]] statement deletes a file designated by a [[STRING]] value or variable.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[KILL]] {{Parameter|fileSpec$}}


* {{Parameter|fileSpec$}} is a literal or variable string path and filename. Wildcards * and ? can be used with caution.
::'''*''' denotes one or more wildcard letters of a name or extension
::'''?''' denotes one wildcard letter of a name or extension

* {{Parameter|fileSpec$}} can include a path that can be either relative to the program's current location or absolute, from the root drive.
* [[KILL]] cannot remove an [[OPEN]] file. The program must [[CLOSE]] it first.  
* If the path or file does not exist, a "File not found" or "Path not found" [[ERROR Codes|error]] will result. See [[_FILEEXISTS]].
* {{InlineCode}}[[SHELL]] "DEL /Q " + fileName${{InlineCodeEnd}} does the same without a prompt or verification for wildcard deletions.
* {{InlineCode}}[[SHELL]] "DEL /P " + fileName${{InlineCodeEnd}} will ask for user verification. 
* Cannot delete folders or directories. Use [[RMDIR]] to remove empty folders.
* '''Warning: files deleted with [[KILL]] will not go to the Recycle Bin and they cannot be restored.'''
