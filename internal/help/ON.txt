ON creates event procedure calls or enables event trapping.


* Set the sub-procedure call for [[KEY(n)]], [[STRIG(n)]], [[TIMER]]

* To turn on event trapping for [[ON KEY (n)]], [[ON STRIG (n)]] and [[ON TIMER (n)]]. 

* In the case of [[ON ERROR]] the trap is also enabled until a subsequent ON ERROR statement.
* ON procedures should be used only in the main program module and not inside of SUB procedures!
* If you have used the [[$CHECKING]]:[[OFF]] metacommand, [[$CHECKING]]:'''ON''' will turn on c++ error checking again.
