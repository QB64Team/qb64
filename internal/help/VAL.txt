The '''VAL''' Function returns the decimal numerical equivalent value of a [[STRING]] numerical value.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: value = VAL(string_value$)


* VAL converts string numbers to numerical values including decimal point values and prefixed &quot;[[&amp;H]]&quot; hexadecimal, &quot;[[&amp;O]]&quot; octal. 
* VAL conversion stops at non-numeric characters except for letter &quot;D&quot; or &quot;E&quot; exponential notation values.
:String values with &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot; letters between numbers may be converted also! EX: '''{{text|VAL(&quot;9D4&quot;) &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; 90000|green}}'''
* If the first string character is not a number VAL returns 0. VAL may return erratic values with &quot;%&quot; or &quot;&amp;&quot; starting characters. 
* Hexadecimal [[HEX$]] string values with the &quot;[[&amp;H]]&quot; prefix can be converted to a decimal value with digits 0 to 9 and letters A to F. 
* Octal [[OCT$]] string values with the &quot;[[&amp;O]]&quot; prefix can be converted to a decimal value with digits from 0 to 7 only.
* Presently VAL '''cannot''' convert QB64 binary [[&amp;B]] prefixed strings from binary to decimal in '''QB64'''.
* For character values of [[ASCII]] data use [[ASC]] to get the value. 


''Example 1:'' Converting a string with some number characters
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
 text$ = &quot;1.23Hello&quot;
 number! = VAL(text$)
 PRINT number! '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
{{OutputStart}}
1.23
{{OutputEnd}}


''Example 2:'' Converting literal and variable [[STRING|string]] values to numerical values.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
 a$ = &quot;33&quot;
 PRINT VAL(&quot;10&quot;) + VAL(a$) + 1 '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
{{OutputStart}}
44
{{OutputEnd}}
:''Explanation:'' 10 + 33 + 1 = 44, the strings were converted to values.

:You have to convert the string to values in order to use them in a mathematical expression also since mixing strings with numbers isn't allowed. VAL will stop at a text letter so VAL(&quot;123G56) would return 123.

:If VAL wasn't used the program would break with an error, as you can't add the value 1 to a string, if the 1 was a string (&quot;1&quot;) then the program would return &quot;10331&quot;, but now since we used VAL, the numbers were added as they should.


''Example 3:'' Converting a hexadecimal value to decimal value using HEX$ with VAL.
{{CodeStart}}
 decnumber% = 96
 hexnumber$ = &quot;&amp;H&quot; + {{Cl|HEX$}}(decnumber%)  'convert decimal value to hex and add hex prefix
 PRINT hexnumber$
 decimal% = {{Cl|VAL}}(hexnumber$)
 PRINT decimal% '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
{{OutputStart}}
&amp;H60
 96
{{OutputEnd}}
: ''Explanation:'' [[HEX$]] converts a decimal number to hexadecimal, but [[VAL]] will only recognize it as a valid value with the &quot;&amp;H&quot; prefix. Especially since hexadecimal numbers can use &quot;A&quot; through &quot;F&quot; in them. Create a converter function from this code!
