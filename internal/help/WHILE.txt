The '''WHILE''' condition is used in [[WHILE...WEND]] or [[DO...LOOP]] loops to exit them.

:: LOOP [WHILE] evaluation


* Only one conditional evaluation can be made at the start or the end of a [[DO...LOOP]].
* DO WHILE evaluates a condition before and inside of the loop. The loop may not run at all.
* LOOP WHILE evaluates a condition inside of the loop. It has to loop once.
* Skips the loop or loops until an evaluation becomes False.
