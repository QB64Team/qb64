Only Windows users need these files.

This is a copy of the "Mingw-w32 (i686) ToolChain" from "http://www.drangon.org/mingw/"

After extraction, the 7 (or so) folders should be manually placed directly into this folder named
"internal\c\c_compiler\"

If you don't have a folder called "internal\c\c_compiler\bin" after extraction you have
done something wrong. There should be about 6 other folders here too.

Due to the large size of the Windows C++ compiler it was not practical to distribute it uncompressed,
expecially under a source revision system.
